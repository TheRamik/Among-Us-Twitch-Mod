## About The Project

This is a mod that allows a Twitch broadcaster's viewers to interact with their Among Us game via Channel Points.

Once set up, this mod will allow Twitch viewers to
* Kill a random player
* Swap positions of all living players

This mod was originally created by [Efren Aguilar](https://github.com/efrenaguilar95) and [Ricky Tham](https://github.com/TheRamik) as part of the [2021 Twitch Channel Point Hackathon.](https://twitchchannelpoints.devpost.com/)


### Built With

* [Twitch API](https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/api/)
* [TwitchLib](https://github.com/TwitchLib/TwitchLib)
* [Reactor](https://github.com/NuclearPowered/Reactor)
* [Harmony](https://github.com/pardeike/Harmony)
* [BepInEx](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx)



## Getting Started

To get the game mod working will require a few steps, as shown below. Streamers will also need to set up the TwitchLib application, instructions for that can be found [here.](https://github.com/TheRamik/Among-Us-Twitch-Mod/tree/main/AUTwitchNetwork)

### Prerequisites

In order to play this mod online, a custom/private server is needed. Using [Impostor](https://github.com/Impostor/Impostor) is probably the easiest way to do this. Before doing anything else, it is highly recommended to get that set up first since this mod will not work without it.

Instructions and downloads for this are linked below, as well as a useful video for those who may need it.

* [Impostor Github](https://github.com/Impostor/Impostor)
* [Video Guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_1hx9DdM88) big shout out to [TroubleChute](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkih2oVTbXPEpVwE-U7kmHw) for making this!

### Installation

Players will need to download the latest "AmongUsTwitchMod" zip folder found [here.](https://github.com/TheRamik/Among-Us-Twitch-Mod/releases)

<img src="images/SteamExample.png" alt="SteamExample">

Once there, open up the Among Us game files/folder. If you have the game on Steam, the easiest way is to do this via the settings button for Among Us.

<img src="images/SteamExample.png" alt="FileExample">

Inside here, unzip the contents of the zip folder. It should then look similar to what is shown above.

Then try running the game. It may take some time to launch the first time, but that's normal. If you see something like what is shown above, you have successfully installed the mod!

### Installation (Streamers Only)

If you are a streamer, you will also need to install the TwitchLib program. Instructions for that can be found [here.](https://github.com/TheRamik/Among-Us-Twitch-Mod/tree/main/AUTwitchNetwork)
